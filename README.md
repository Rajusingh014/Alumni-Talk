# Alumni-Talk
Alumni Talk is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between college alumni and freshers. It provides a digital platform where students can connect, communicate, and share experiences â€” helping freshers get career guidance, internship advice, and job referrals directly from alumni of their own branch.
